# XS-Leaks Wiki
## Overview

Cross-site leaks (aka XS-Leaks, XSLeaks) are a class of vulnerabilities derived from browser side-channel techniques [^side-channel]. These techniques are similar to Cross-site request forgery [^csrf] (CSRF) techniques, but instead of allowing other websites to perform actions on behalf of a user, they can be used to infer information about a user. This is done by exploiting a variety of features built in to browsers [^browser-features].


## The principle of an XS-Leak

The fact that websites interact with each other is core to the behavior of the web. Browsers provide a wide variety of interfaces to support such interactions between different web applications. These interfaces have different security measures built on top which are intended to constrain the behavior of websites (e.g. the [Same-Origin Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)). XS-Leaks take advantage of small pieces of information that can leak during these interactions in order to infer sensitive information about users such as their data on other websites, operating systems they use, or internal networks they are connected to.

These pieces of information usually have a binary form and are referred to as "oracles". These oracles usually answer with *YES* or *NO* to cleverly prepared questions. For example, an oracle can be asked:

> Does the word *secret* exist in the search results?

In a vulnerable application, the above question might be equivalent to asking:

> Does the query *?query=secret* return *HTTP200* status code?

Since it is possible to detect the *HTTP200* status code with [Error Events]({{< ref "./docs/attacks/error-events.md" >}}), this has the same effect as asking:

> Does the query *?query=secret* trigger the *onload* event?

The above query could be repeated by an attacker for many different keywords, and as a result the answers could be used to infer sensitive information about the user from a cross-site website.

Browsers provide a wide range of different APIs that, while well-intended, can end up leaking small amounts of cross-origin information.

## Example

Websites are not allowed to directly access data on other websites, but they can load resources from them and observe the side effects. For example, *evil.com* is forbidden from explicitly reading a response from *bank.com*, but *evil.com* can attempt to load a script from *bank.com* and determine whether or not it successfully loaded.

{{< hint example >}}

Suppose that *bank.com* has an API endpoint that returns data about a user's receipt for a given type of transaction.

1. *evil.com* can attempt to load the URL *bank.com/my_receipt?q=groceries* as a script. By default, the browser attaches cookies when loading resources, so the request to *bank.com* will carry the user's credentials.
2. If the user has recently bought groceries, the script loads successfully with an *HTTP 200* status code. If the user hasn't bought groceries, the request fails to load with an *HTTP 404* status code, which triggers an [Error Event]({{< ref "./docs/attacks/error-events.md" >}}).
3. By listening to the error event and repeating this approach with different queries, the attacker can infer a significant amount of information about the user's transaction history.
{{< /hint >}}

In the example above, two websites of two different origins (*evil.com* and *bank.com*) interacted through an API that browsers allow websites to use.  This interaction didn't exploit any vulnerabilities in the browser or in *bank.com*, but it still allowed *evil.com* to gain information about the user's data on *bank.com*.  



## Root cause of XS-Leaks

The root cause of most XS-Leaks is inherent to the design of the web. Oftentimes applications are vulnerable to some cross-site information leaks without having done anything wrong. It is challenging to fix the root cause of XS-Leaks at the browser level because in many cases doing so would break existing websites. For this reason, browsers are now implementing various [Defense Mechanisms]({{< ref "defenses" >}}) to overcome these difficulties. Many of these defenses require websites to opt in to a more restrictive security model, usually through the use of certain HTTP headers (e.g. *[Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy]({{< ref "./docs/defenses/opt-in/coop.md">}}): same-origin*), which often must be combined to achieve the desired outcome.

We can distinguish different sources of XS-Leaks, such as:

1. Browser APIs (e.g. [Frame Counting]({{< ref "frame-counting.md" >}}) and [Timing Attacks]({{< ref "timing-attacks.md" >}}))
2. Browser implementation details and bugs (e.g. [Connection Pooling]({{< ref "./docs/attacks/timing-attacks/connection-pool.md" >}}) and [typeMustMatch]({{< ref "./docs/attacks/historical/content-type.md#typemustmatch" >}}))
3. Hardware bugs (e.g. Speculative Execution Attacks [^spectre])

## A little bit of history

XS-Leaks have long been part of the web platform;  [timing attacks]({{< ref "network-timing.md" >}}) to leak information about the user's web activity have been known since at least [2000](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/352600.352606).

This class of issues has steadily attracted more attention [^old-wiki] as new techniques were found to increase their impact. In 2015, Gelernter and Herzberg published "Cross-Site Search Attacks" [^xs-search-first] which covered their work on exploiting timing attacks to implement high impact XS-Search attacks against web applications built by Google and Microsoft. Since then, more XS-Leak techniques have been discovered and tested.

Recently, browsers have implemented a variety of new [defense mechanisms]({{< ref "defenses" >}}) that make it easier to protect applications from XS-Leaks.

## About this wiki

This wiki is meant to both introduce readers to XS-Leaks and serve as a reference guide for experienced researchers exploiting XS-Leaks. While this wiki contains information on many different techniques, new techniques are always emerging. Improvements, whether they add new techniques or expand existing pages, are always appreciated!
